A simple demonstration app for Android that tracks when a listener last listened to a mix by [DJ Zyron](http://zyron.c64.org/mixes.php), and allows them to follow the mix using [Discogs lists](https://www.discogs.com/user/Zyron/lists?page=1&limit=100&header=1) if a list exists.

This repository is being actively developed on a daily basis.  This is a companion project to the [Spring Boot API Zyronator](https://github.com/jmkapp/Spring-Boot-Kotlin-Zyronator).

This project demonstrates:
* Consuming a third party API (Discogs)
* Reading and writing to a purpose written API ([Spring Boot API Zyronator](https://github.com/jmkapp/Spring-Boot-Kotlin-Zyronator))
* Use of Retrofit2
* Passing data to an external app (web browser)
* Basic authentication
* Storing Shared Preferences
